🧠 Brain Tumor Classification & Segmentation Web App
This project is a web-based application designed to perform Brain Tumor Image Classification and Segmentation using deep learning models. The website allows users to upload MRI brain scan images and get both classification (tumor or no tumor) and segmentation results (highlighting the tumor region if detected).
